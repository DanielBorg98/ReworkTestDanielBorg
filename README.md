# Installation

`composer install` 

`artisan migrate --seed` 

`npm install` 

`npm run dev` 

Url for product create is `localhost/products/create` 

There is a sql dump of the initial tables and contents in `database\snapshots\` however this shouldn't be needed as migration/seeders should build out everything initially needed.
